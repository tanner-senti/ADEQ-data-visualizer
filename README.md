# ADEQ-data-visualizer
This is an unofficial project in active development

Pull data from Arkansas DEQ's Water Quality Monitoring Database and plot. Database is publicly available as an .mdb file from https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/techsvs/env_multi_lab/water_quality_station.aspx, thus hosting this app on a linux server (like shinyapps.io) will cause errors and default to a backup Duck.db database.

See an example of this app deployed at:  https://i24os8-tanner-senti.shinyapps.io/ADEQ-data-visualizer/
