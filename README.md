# ADEQ-data-visualizer
This project is in active development

Pull data from Arkansas DEQ's Water Quality Monitoring Database and plot. Database is available as an .mdb file, thus hosting this app on a linux server (like shinyapps.io) will cause errors and default to a backup SQLite database.

See an example of this app deployed at:  https://i24os8-tanner-senti.shinyapps.io/ADEQ-data-visualizer/
